    "baseModelAnswer": "Let's break this down step by step!\n\n1. In 1992, 30% of families owned a personal computer. Let's call the total number of families in City X in 1992 \"x\". Then, the number of families owning a computer in 1992 is 0.3x.\n2. In 1999, the number of families owning a computer is 50% greater than it was in 1992. This means the number of families owning a computer in 1999 is 0.3x + 0.3x * 0.5 = 0.45x.\n3. The total number of families in City X in 1999 is 5% greater than it was in 1992. This means the total number of families in City X in 1999 is x + 0.05x = 1.05x.\n4. We know that the number of families owning a computer in 1999 is 0.45x, and the total number of families in City X in 1999 is 1.05x. We can set up an equation to find the percentage of families owning a computer in 1999:\n\n0.45x / 1.05x = 0.4285\n\nTo convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100:\n\n0.4285 * 100 = 42.85%\n\nSo, the correct answer is (B) 42.85%.",

    "groundTruthAnswer": "To determine if the function is analytic, we first need to check if it is differentiable. Since $f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 3$ is a polynomial function, it is differentiable everywhere in the complex plane, including at $z = 1 + 2i$. Therefore, the function is analytic at $z = 1 + 2i$.\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of the function:\n\n$f'(z) = \\frac{d}{dz}(z^2 - 2z + 3) = 2z - 2$\n\nNow, we can evaluate the derivative at the point $z = 1 + 2i$:\n\n$f'(1 + 2i) = 2(1 + 2i) - 2 = 2 + 4i - 2 = 4i$\n\nSo, the derivative of the function $f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 3$ at the point $z = 1 + 2i$ is $f'(1 + 2i) = 4i$.",

    "fineTunedModelAnswer": "A function is analytic at a point if it is differentiable in some neighborhood of that point. In this case, we can check if the function is differentiable by finding its derivative.\n\nThe function is given by $f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 3$. To find its derivative, we can use the rules of differentiation for complex functions. Since the derivative of a complex function is a complex function, we can treat the complex variable $z$ as a combination of its real and imaginary parts, i.e., $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit.\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of $f(z)$ with respect to $z$:\n\n$f'(z) = \\frac{d}{dz}(z^2 - 2z + 3) = \\frac{d}{dz}((x + yi)^2 - 2(x + yi) + 3)$\n\nUsing the properties of complex numbers, we can rewrite the expression as:\n\n$f'(z) = \\frac{d}{dz}((x^2 - 2x + 3) + (2xy - 2y)i)$\n\nNow, we can differentiate each part separately:\n\n$f'(z) = \\frac{d}{dz}(x^2 - 2x + 3) + \\frac{d}{dz}(2xy - 2y)i$\n\n$f'(z) = (2x - 2) + (2y)i$\n\nNow, we can find the derivative at the point $z = 1 + 2i$:\n\n$f'(1 + 2i) = (2(1) - 2) + (2(2))i = 0 + 4i$\n\nSo, the function $f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 3$ is analytic at $z = 1 + 2i$, and its derivative at that point is $f'(1 + 2i) = 4i$."
