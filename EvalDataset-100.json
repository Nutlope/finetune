Check if the graph can be decomposed into a tree of smaller cliques (subgraphs where every vertex is connected to every other vertex) with the determined treewidth.\n\nStep 1: Find an upper bound for the treewidth\nThe maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 10 vertices is given by the formula n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of vertices. In this case, n = 10, so the maximum number of edges is 10(9)/2 = 45. Since G has 16 edges, it is not a complete graph (a graph where every vertex is connected to every other vertex).\n\nThe maximum degree of a vertex in G is at most 8 (since it cannot be connected to itself). According to the degree-based upper bound for treewidth, the treewidth is at most the maximum degree, so the treewidth of G is at most 8.\n\nStep 2: Check if the graph can be decomposed into a tree of smaller cliques\nTo determine if the graph can be decomposed into a tree of smaller cliques, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Start with the treewidth upper bound (8 in this case).\n2. Check if it is possible to decompose the graph into a tree of cliques with the current treewidth.\n3. If it is not possible, decrease the treewidth by 1 and repeat step 2.\n\nSince we don't have the exact structure of the graph, we cannot perform this step directly. However, we can provide some general observations:\n\n- If the graph is connected and has a treewidth of 8, it means that there is a tree decomposition where each bag (node in the tree decomposition) contains a clique of size 9 (treewidth + 1).\n- If the graph is not connected, its treewidth is the maximum treewidth of its connected components.\n\nIn conclusion, without knowing the exact structure of the graph, we can only determine that the treewidth of G is at most 8. To find the exact treewidth, more information about the graph's structure is needed."
