    "instruction": "Here's a precise numerical problem related to the principal-agent problem in game theory:\n\nConsider a principal-agent relationship where the principal hires an agent to perform a task that will generate a profit of $100. The principal can offer a contract that offers a fixed payment of $70, or a payment of $x plus a bonus of 30% of the profit the agent generates. The agent can choose to work hard (H) or shirk (S), with probabilities P(H) = 0.8 and P(S) = 0.2.\n\nIf the principal offers the fixed payment of $70, the agent will choose to work hard. If the principal offers the alternative contract, what should be the value of x that maximizes the principal's profit? \n\nAssume that the agent's utility function is U = P(H)*Profit - C(H), where C(H) is the cost to the agent of working hard. The agent's cost of working hard is $50, so C(H) = $50, and the agent's cost of shirking is 0.",
    "output": "To find the value of x that maximizes the principal's profit, we need to consider the agent's utility function and the principal's profit function.\n\nThe agent's utility function is U = P(H)*Profit - C(H). If the agent works hard (H), the utility function is U(H) = 0.8*(x + 0.3*100) - 50, and if the agent shirks (S), the utility function is U(S) = 0.2*(x + 0.3*100).\n\nThe agent will choose to work hard if U(H) > U(S), so we have:\n\n0.8*(x + 30) - 50 > 0.2*(x + 30)\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\n0.6*(x + 30) > 50\nx + 30 > 50/0.6\nx > (50/0.6) - 30\nx > 83.33 - 30\nx > 53.33\n\nSo, the minimum value of x that will make the agent work hard is $53.33.\n\nNow, let's consider the principal's profit function. If the principal offers the alternative contract, the profit function is:\n\nProfit = 100 - (x + 0.3*100)\nProfit = 100 - x - 30\nProfit = 70 - x\n\nTo maximize the principal's profit, we need to minimize the value of x. Since we found that the minimum value of x that will make the agent work hard is $53.33, this is the value of x that maximizes the principal's profit.\n\nTherefore, the value of x that maximizes the principal's profit is $53.33."
